## Introduction
Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are widely used by modern malware to dynamically generate seemingly random domain names. These domains serve as communication points to Command & Control (C&C) servers, making it difficult for traditional security mechanisms like blacklists to keep up. Effective detection of DGA domains is therefore a key topic in cybersecurity. State-of-the-art approaches leverage machine learning and deep learning to distinguish DGA domains from legitimate ones. Techniques include classical ML models, LSTM, RNN, and Transformer architectures, as well as recent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs).
