| UMUDGA - University of Murcia Domain Generation Algorithm Dataset     | AGD analysis and, therefore, we advocate two major contributions in this article: i) a thorough analysis of the cyber panorama in terms of botnets that make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) as evasive techniques, that flows into ii) a full-fledged machine-learning-ready labelled dataset that features over 30 million AGDs sorted in 50 malware variant classes.            | .csv, .arff, .txt                                   | [Link](https://osint.bambenekconsulting.com/feeds/)                  |
